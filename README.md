I was only following along with the youtube video (link above) to produce the code in this repository.  I did not follow along exactly, as the video quality leaves a lot to be desired and I had to troubleshoot at points throughout the video to get everything functioning.  I also took several liberties with the design to make it look better *in my opinion*.

Thanks!
